### üèÖ REDIS

Configuring Redis as a cache for your WordPress site helps to improve the site's performance and speed by storing frequently accessed data in memory. This reduces the load on the database and speeds up the site's response time.
Benefits of Using Redis as a Cache

- Performance Improvement: Redis is an extremely fast in-memory data store, which means it can provide data much faster than a traditional disk-based database.
- Reduced Database Load: By storing frequently accessed data in Redis, you reduce the number of database queries, which can improve the scalability and stability of your site.
- Faster Response Time: With data stored in memory, the response time for end users is significantly reduced.
- Efficient Session Management: Redis can be used to store user sessions, which is more efficient than storing sessions in the database or file system.

#### Conclusion

Configuring Redis as a cache for your WordPress site can significantly improve site performance, reduce database load, and provide a faster and more efficient user experience.

#### How to Test?

```shell
docker logs redis

docker exec -it redis bash

redis-cli

PING
```
```shell
SET my_key "my_value"
# response: OK

GET my_key
# response: "my_value"

KEYS *
# response: 1 "my_key"
```

### üèÖ FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

Setting up an FTP server container pointing to your WordPress site's volume helps facilitate the transfer of files between your local computer and the server where the WordPress site is hosted. This is useful for managing WordPress files, such as themes, plugins, media uploads, and other configuration files.
Benefits of Using an FTP Server

- Ease of File Transfer: It allows you to easily send and receive files between your local computer and the server.
- File Management: It makes it easy to edit, delete, and organize files on the server.
- Backup and Restore: It allows you to back up your site files and restore them when necessary.
- Remote Access: You can access your site files from anywhere, as long as you have an internet connection.

#### Conclusion

Setting up an FTP server container pointing to your WordPress site's volume facilitates the transfer and management of WordPress files. This is especially useful for developers and site administrators who need to access and modify site files efficiently and securely.

#### How to Test?

```shell
echo HELLO > aaa.txt
docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' ftp
ftp ftp <ftp value>
```

```shell
NAME: <see in .env>
PASS: <see in .env>
```

```shell
ls -la
cd files
put aaa.txt
get aaa.txt bbb.txt
exit
```

```shell
diff aaa.txt bbb.txt
cat aaa.txt
cat bbb.txt
```

### üèÖ STATIC WEBSITE

replace 'login' for yor login in 42'school

### üèÖ ADMINER

Adminer is a web-based database management tool that allows users to interact with databases easily and intuitively. Here are some key points about Adminer:

- Web Interface: Adminer provides a simple and user-friendly web interface for managing databases.
    Support for Multiple Databases: It supports multiple database management systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MS SQL, Oracle, and others.
- Features: Allows you to execute SQL queries, manage tables, view and edit data, create and delete databases, and much more.
- Simple Installation: It is easy to install and configure, usually requiring just a single PHP file.
- Security: Offers various security options, including user authentication and support for secure connections.

#### How to Test?

http://localhost:8080/adminer.php

#### How to use the credentials:

System:    MySQL
Server:    [MDB_HOST]
Username:  [MDB_USER]
Password:  [MDB_PASSWORD]
Database:  [MDB_NAME]

### üèÖ PROMETHEUS

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting tool initially developed by SoundCloud. It is widely used to monitor systems and services, collecting metrics in real time and allowing the creation of alerts based on these metrics. Here are some key points about Prometheus:

- Metric Collection: Prometheus collects metrics from services and systems, storing them in a time-series database.
- Data Querying: Uses a query language called PromQL to enable powerful and flexible queries on the collected data.
- Alerting: Integrates with Alertmanager to send alerts based on user-defined rules.
- Exporters: Uses exporters to collect metrics from different systems and services. There are exporters for a wide range of services, such as databases, operating systems, and much more.
- Visualization: Can be integrated with visualization tools like Grafana to create interactive dashboards and data visualizations.

#### How to Test?

http://localhost:9090

#### How to get the metrics?

```shell
curl http://localhost:9090/metrics
```

The output you've shared is a typical metrics endpoint response from a Prometheus monitoring setup. It provides a wealth of information about the state and performance of your application. Let‚Äôs break down the key sections and what they represent:

##### Go Runtime Metrics
- go_gc_duration_seconds: Metrics related to garbage collection duration. It includes quantiles (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) and aggregate metrics like sum and count.
- go_goroutines: The number of goroutines currently running.
- go_info: Information about the Go environment, including the Go version used.
- go_memstats_*: Metrics related to memory usage:
- alloc_bytes: Memory allocated and still in use.
- heap_*: Various heap metrics such as allocated, idle, in use, and released bytes.
- mallocs_total, frees_total: Total allocations and deallocations.
- next_gc_bytes: Estimated number of bytes at the next garbage collection.

##### Network Metrics
- net_conntrack_dialer_*: Metrics related to network connections tracked by different dialers (e.g., default, prometheus), including attempted, closed, established, and failed connections.
- net_conntrack_listener_*: Metrics for connections handled by listeners, such as the HTTP listener in this case.

##### Process Metrics
- process_*: Metrics related to the process itself:
- cpu_seconds_total: Total CPU time spent by the process.
- max_fds, open_fds: Maximum and current number of open file descriptors.
- resident_memory_bytes, virtual_memory_bytes: Memory usage metrics.
- start_time_seconds: Process start time.

##### Prometheus Server Metrics
- prometheus_*: Metrics about the Prometheus server‚Äôs own performance and state:
- api_remote_read_queries: Number of remote read queries being processed.
- build_info: Metadata about the Prometheus build.
- engine_queries: Current number of queries being executed or waiting.
- http_request_duration_seconds: Latency of HTTP requests, broken down by handler and duration.

##### Query Metrics
- prometheus_engine_query_duration_seconds: Metrics on query execution times, broken down by different stages of query processing (e.g., prepare_time, queue_time).

##### What You Can Do With This Information?

- Performance Monitoring: Use these metrics to monitor the performance and health of your application and the Prometheus server itself. For instance, high go_gc_duration_seconds might indicate that garbage collection is taking a significant amount of time.
- Debugging: Metrics like go_goroutines or process_open_fds can help identify resource usage patterns and potential issues.
- Capacity Planning: Metrics such as memory usage (process_resident_memory_bytes, go_memstats_heap_sys_bytes) can assist in planning for future capacity needs.
